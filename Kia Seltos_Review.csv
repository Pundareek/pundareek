3,Shivam,Kia Seltos is a great car. Having fully loaded features of next-generation and the best thing about it is the looks those DRLs which glow all the way from left to right. Even the engine power is best in class. Which could be easily seen on the roads nowadays and on their booking lists. The Kia motors gave a tough competition. It shook the whole market with its Seltos. The only thing I didn't like is the logo it should be somewhat different.,"Dec 20, 2019",5
4,Upinder Pal Singh,"The front end of the Seltos is particularly impressive. The huge Tiger Nose grille is Kia's design trademark, has a knurled aluminium finish, with a contrasting black plastic grille.

11,Nik,"I tried to ignore writing a review of the car. But the quality, performance and overall comfort of the car forced me to do so. I am here writing about Kia Seltos. Using this car for a bit now with decent 10000km on record. The car will not at all disappoint you in terms of pickup and driving comfort. The seats hold you so well and on top of it the response that you get from the steering. Really impressed. I have also driven another SUV's like Creta, Nissan kicks Mahindra XUV. But Kia has really made its presence and you will feel that in every term of the car. Drove the car on hilly terrain and the motor inside it gives you that punch even if driving on a steep upward hill. No power lag nothing. It's worth buying no second thoughts to look around. Best in class.","Dec 19, 2019",5
12,Law Officer,"The best you can have out of mid-class SUV, the interior is just ravishing like exterior and compliment each other, boss music system is par excellence.

70,Dubbaka Vishal,"The Kia Seltos is good in every possible way, but there is a huge downside to the Seltos in case of pricing, where the vehicle is manufactured in Andhrapradesh the prices must be a bit low as all the other rival are priced very less in spite of manufacturing out of India. There is one thing Kia should implement which is it should provide the essential features like 360 camera,6 airbags even in the HT line as these are essential.","Dec 13, 2019",3

87,Devanathan Janakiraman,"The car looks like SUV but not the real SUV. The petrol engine never makes any noise but here I can see unexpected things. IVT is lazy. Manual petrol and 1.4 is good. Diesel major looks difference from petrol even the grill and the bumper not matching with. Petrol 1.4 and diesel have all the disc brake, not the other petrol. Bose speaker is only available on the top variant. Not an offroader. BS6 fuel not available all the places few cars indicate engine issues already in diesel variant.","Dec 12, 2019",3

91,Praful Pradhan,"I'm driving the Kia Seltos HTK+ Diesel model. Overall the car is best. I have driven it 6500kms, but still no issue. Pick up is great. Mileage is around 21kms also best on bad roads. The car is best on curve road to have great grip. Infotainment is good. Some issues with Android Auto gets disconnected within1hr. But with a software update, it will get resolved. Seats are very comfortable and backside you can have a big space after folding it.","Dec 11, 2019",5

98,Gaurav Negi,"Good car with the futuristic and latest tech, appealing to masses especially gen x,y, and z. Looks sturdy, has road presence and a differentiator when runs on the road, a masculine look which is attracting most of the young people. Multiple variants and both manual and auto transmission options make it a top seller. The only area where it needs to work on is the mileage, which is not at its best compared to other vehicles available competing with Seltos. Mileage is 8-10 which is slightly on the lower side. Ride quality is excellent with very low engine noise. Good torque and control at high speeds and turns.","Dec 11, 2019",4
99,Ajay Vyas,"It's a good looking car, nice performance, comfort level is good and luxurious. The interior is very attractive and of good quality.","Dec 11, 2019",4
100,Sandeep,"Fantastic tuned engine, hi-tech entertainment system, great build quality, comfortable seats and decor, first time ever air filters in the car and brilliant suspension. I have been driving Seltos HTX Diesel for 1000 km now and the car never ceases to surprise. More airbags could have helped and the rear seat could have been a bit longer for supporting the knees. Great mileage and BS 6 compliance are a bonus. For the discerning buyers, this is a competitively priced offering. Much better choice compared to MG Hector, Harrier and XUV as this is designed keeping the Indian consumer in mind. Unlike other auto manufacturers, Kia Seltos is not a copy & paste of a foreign model but a fundamentally well-designed car for Indian conditions. Thrills all the way.","Dec 11, 2019",5

103,Nilesh,These new entrants are not as per the safety norms. Only features and comprising on safety. People in India are not looking at safety ratings while purchasing a car like playing with life. This is well understood by these vehicle manufacturers and hence they are putting only features. I think safety should be first.,"Dec 11, 2019",3
104,Nikhil Hatwar,"If we talk about the overall ratings of Seltos, no one can give a proper review. When I started the engine, the sound was so negligible that I cannot tell you the silence in the cabin. The power to thrust ratio is well explained in this Car. Even if you scale at 3rd gear. The engine seems to be smooth and amazing. I would suggest Seltos over The Hector and the Harrier.","Dec 11, 2019",5
105,Ramees Bakker,"The car is great at handling and suspension is set good for the Indian roads. Good design in exterior as well as interior, The engine shows good aggressiveness in the real world. Offroad experience is good too because of the suspension and the projector headlights. The space that the car offers in the second row and in the boot is pretty good. The car looks great in the outer world.","Dec 10, 2019",4
106,Naag,"Excellent SUV with modern technology, style, performance, handling, comfort. Perfect vehicle by Kia. Impressed with the long list of features including Head's up display, Air purifier, 360 camera with the blind-spot camera. Kia plays a key role in the Indian market.","Dec 10, 2019",5

108,Ganesh Reddy Kolan,Seltos is a big hit in India. Kia released their first car and got a massive hike. The horsepower and 1-liter turbo charge is just lit. It became the fourth largest car producing companies in India already. The screen in the car is just awesome and should've got panoramic sunroof competing for the MG Hector. The speed is pretty good.,"Dec 10, 2019",5

120,Akshat Jain,"This is actually the best offering in the current price range. People have been cribbing about features, well then pay for it! You forget it's technically not an Indian company, so taxes are more! The range-topping GTX+ model which now also comes in both petrol and diesel comes with features that none of the vehicles in the current market offer. 6 Airbags are standard in the GTX+ models. As is ABS and EBD! The suspension might not be as good as the Harrier's, but then you forget what has the suspension from the Range Rover Discovery. So in short, this is actually the best suspension in the mid-size SUV segment. At 20.5 lakhs (on-road TN) for the ranging topping editions, this automobile is pretty much the best that you can get. Servicing might be an issue for now. But if Hyundai is able to provide support in any way, I believe KIA will never let us down in that regard either. The end result is that KIA was able to bring in a very trendy and highly-equipped package into the Indian market, and at a very good time too!","Dec 09, 2019",5

I can safely say that this is the best overall car in this price range presently. This car is a near-perfect vehicle by many angles. Its design is fantastic, looks are fantastic, features are amazing, refinement is excellent, NVH levels are superb, ride quality is superb and easily comparable to my Innova Crysta. Diesel manual mileage is excellent, seat comfort is superb. The back seat of this vehicle occupies 3 people comfortably. Boot space has enough space for the luggage of five people for a short trip. I drove this vehicle on really ugly Bhokar-Nanded road of Maharashtra (bad would be a word for this road at present which I think) and I can assure you that , this vehicle has one of the best ride quality which can be easily comparable to my Innova Crysta in terms of ride quality. Seltos is breeze to drive. I drove the petrol GT line also for short distances, and it is also a great variant to own. You can go for either variant as per your needs and choice. Both variants are great. Diesel is giving me 17kmpl overall at present for 60% highway and 40% city drive with AC 100% on. I hope, mileage will definitely increase after the second service(oil change) to 19Kmpl overall. A smart air purifier with perfume diffuser is an added advantage. AC is powerful and works fantastically. In my opinion, At present, there is no competitor for Seltos, when it comes to the overall package.","Dec 01, 2019",5
